# FeedLand server install

Instructions for setting up a FeedLand server.

### Under development

We will start testing the install process for FeedLand server the week of January 23, 2023. 

If you have access to this site, you can try installing from the instructions, if you want. Report any problems as issues in this repo. 

### About FeedLand

I've been running a FeedLand server myself since October 2022. 

It was always the plan to let other people run their own FeedLand instances, but first I wanted to be sure the server ran reasonably smoothly, and the UI was stable. 

I think at the beginning of 2023 we've gotten there. 

Hence this package.

### How to install

When you follow <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/docs/setup.md">these instructions</a> you will have a FeedLand instance running on your server.

You can use it yourself, or share it with others. Or use both models at the same time. 

If you're just using it yourself it does not have to be accessible over the net.
