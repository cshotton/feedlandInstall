# How to sign up to use your instance of FeedLand

This is the first release of the new mechanism for creating a user account in FeedLand, so it's a good idea to say in one place, how to do that.

1. Enter the URL of your FeedLand instance into a browser. You should be greeted by a <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/25/introductoryDialog.png">dialog</a> inviting you to sign in or sign up. Click the <i>Sign up</i> button.

2. A <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/25/signupDialog.png">dialog</a> appears asking you to enter a name and an email address. Both must be unique. The name must be at least four characters long. The dialog will tell you as you type if the name you've entered is available. When you're ready click the <i>Send</i> button. 

3. You're prompted to check your email. When you do there should be an email whose subject is "FeedLand confirmation". There's a link in the email. Click it. 

4. You should be taken back to your FeedLand instance. A dialog asking if you want to subscribe to a few feeds to get started.
