# How to sign up to use your instance of FeedLand

This is the first release of the new mechanism for creating a user account in FeedLand, so it's a good idea to say in one place, how to do that.

1. Enter the URL of your FeedLand instance into a browser. You should be greeted by a dialog inviting you to sign in or sign up. Click the Sign Up button.

2. A dialog appears asking you to enter a name and an email address. <a href="http://scripting.com/images/2023/01/25/signupDialog.png">Screen shot</a>. Both must be unique. The name must be at least four characters long. The dialog will tell you as you type if the name you've entered is available. Click the <i>Send</i> button. 

3. You are prompted to check your email. When you do there should be an email whose subject is "FeedLand confirmation." There's a link in the email. Click it. 

4. You should be taken back to your FeedLand instance. A dialog asking if you want to subscribe to a few feeds to get started.
