# How to install Node

I asked <a href="https://chat.openai.com">chat.openai.com</a> to write this for me. :-)

### How to

To install Node.js, you can download the installer package from the <a href="https://nodejs.org/">official website</a> and run it on your computer. The installer will guide you through the process of installing Node.js and updating your system path to include the Node.js executable.

Alternatively, you can install Node.js using a package manager such as apt (on Ubuntu) or brew (on macOS).

On Ubuntu:

```

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install nodejs

```

On MacOS:

`brew install node`

You can check the version of Node.js that you have installed by running the command node -v in your terminal.
