# About source.opml

I write code in an outliner, and it generates the code in this repo from the outline. So what you see as source on GitHub actually isn't what I edit. I couldn't accept a pull request to the generated code. It would just be wiped out the next time I made a change to the outline and re-generated

So the best thing to do when you spot a mistake is flag it as an issue in the repo, point to the code in question if that's helpful, and I'll thank you and make the fix myself.

And if you want to add a feature and have it included in this distribution, post an issue and let's talk about it. ;-)

BTW, if you have an outliner handy, you can read the source the way I wrote it. I always try to include a source.opml file in my projects, as I do <a href="https://github.com/scripting/feedlandInstall/blob/main/source.opml">here</a>. 

You can read the code in source.opml by <a href="http://gitsourcereader.opml.org/?repo=feedlandInstall">clicking this link</a>.
